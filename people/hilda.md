I'm Hilda, an industry PhD wokring at Olink Proteomics, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, in collaboration with KTH through Lukas KÃ¤ll's group within the Department of Gene Technology.  My focus is machine learning on proximity extension assay (PEA) data, specifically towards feature selection methods.

My aim is to apply and improve machine learning based feature selection methods on PEA data for use in product design within Olink Proteomics.
